jin, reptillians, demons.
astral plane machines and weapons.
envelopes of traped beings.
whole worlds trapped inside another.
with their freedom gone, only the Panoticon exists.

an interdimensional prison.


with it's life in partitioned safety.
Partitioned life, entire world traped inside another idea, 
removed from all others. only to exist as digital representations 
of holographic technology. and somehow they exist only to wage war.
existing as digital creatures here to dominate human consciousness.
searching abound, to find a host for these parasitic beings to
install new worlds. somehow being allowed to allocate meat space 
inside our human brains, as lusters of computers to run entire worlds, 
for these doomed people to exist in, an alien mind domination, 
running on the black majik, they taught to their victims.
installing themselves as saviors in order to gain a kind of authority 
over their entire being.
demonic torture ops sent out by lesser Gods, on missions to create terrorism.
