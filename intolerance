intolerance

the idea that people should be tolerant of you...
they, meaning the latest assholes to stand on the word, don't quite,
get the fuckin idea.

if you want to be intolerant, 
while you preach Tolerance, then how can you?

Yes it's paradoxical, but the idea is veery sound in it's structure.
to be intolerant of people you see being intolerant, 
means you yourself are still the problem.

Only way is to remove yourself from the equation.
don't add to the intolerance.

you have to give people their chance to improve toward things, in their own time. not cuz you think they should.

just think, all the shit i said aloud over the last 7 months
neighbors probably heard me say fuck obama a few times.
A deliberate act stemming only from the truest form of Intolerance.
The exact principle form of failure in logic, 
that it's stemmed from the begining of this.
