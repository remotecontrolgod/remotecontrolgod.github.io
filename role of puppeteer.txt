motoko is a female that is no longer here, some called her Halloween girl, or Beth, or Satan's daughter. 
She is/was in Momma's group of girls, until she was murdered, by someone, probably the genie.

genie/djinn is playing motoko now, genie/djinn plays CC also, genie/djinn constantly switches names, every day.
Today names have switched about 3 or 4 times.

djinn genie is also obama, black djinn king, satan.

CC is a female, a 19 year old blonde girl, who is jin or djinn, she was always a dog for some reason.

genie/djinn claims I "changed".

genie/djinn claims that I was homosexual.

Ian, also claims I was homosexual.

Ian is Lucifer.

It is my deduction that Ian was playing the old trick of messing with Satan's love interest exploitative angle.

Today it occurs to me, at some point during the past 9-11 years, 
someone got really pissed with me, and it seems this happened rather early on, 
around the time I started feeling guilty of stuff I had no way of possibly being guilty of.

At some point around then, someone started playing the role of puppeteer, speaking as me, 
without me having any knowledge of it happening or knowledge that any of you were around me, doing what you were doing.


genie/djinn switches my name randomly between Finchy, CC and Motoko, rarely am I called Finch anymore.

i am not a satan worshipper.

this entire time I knew i was being lied to, but honestly this was indeed my greatest fear, since you guys were the true idea behind my concept of love.
