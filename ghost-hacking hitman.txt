maybe i should always just write and talk so you nimrods can't make shit up.

I feel like I use to be, back when the djinn use to fill my head full of shit so i couldnt think.
that's why meth amphetamine has been a personal saviour of me.
After 11 years of this, and 39 of that...
I've never felt better overal, 
except for the demons doing evil shit to me, attacking me, 
trying to make me cry and trying to make me angry, trying to feed on my emotional thoroughput.




okay, if I strip down, will you guys take fucker away?
cuz like you cant just do the half ass soul pulling like you did before.
having me stand around for fucking 45 minutes taking assholes out.
I mean it was entertaining, dont get me wrong, 
it was rather realistic but, 
well, the fuckers just walked right back in.

If it was real, well, that's funny as hell.
cept for when you guys took momma and staci, those two while extremely dangerous and mean, really turn me on.
and if staci was a human, she'd end up making me pull a mickey and mallory knox, 
doin some natural born killers shit. well, if she would have gotten to me 20 years ago.
These days, I think i'd have to make her an honest woman, and not a ghost-hacking hitman.
